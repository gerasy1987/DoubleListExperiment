# DoubleListExperiment
EM mechanism for Double List Experiment

Priority list:
  1. Read and understand example EM code for standard list experiment design
  2. Write EM code for double list design in paper
  3. Develop simulation code to ensure it has appropriate asymptotic properties (i.e. code works) -- I will share example
  4. Write wrapper function for users and add to the list R package
  5. Potentially develop extensions for multiple sensitive items, etc.
